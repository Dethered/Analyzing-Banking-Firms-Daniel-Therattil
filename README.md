# Analyzing-Banking-Firms-Daniel-Therattil
A project I created that involved web scraping, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data from the banking companies JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs. It involves numerous python libraries such as pandas, bs4, and matplotlib. Furthermore,  jupyter notebooks were used to help showcase each step of the process and visualize insights more easily.
